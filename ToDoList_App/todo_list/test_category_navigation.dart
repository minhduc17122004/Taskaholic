/// Test file to demonstrate the new category navigation features
/// 
/// This file outlines the new functionality implemented:
/// 
/// 1. Category Screen Navigation:
///    - Tapping a category in the Category screen now navigates back to Home
///    - The Home screen automatically filters tasks for the selected category
///    - The AppBar title updates to show the selected category name
/// 
/// 2. PopupMenuButton on Home Screen:
///    - Added a filter icon (Icons.filter_list) in the AppBar actions
///    - Shows a dropdown menu with all available categories
///    - Currently selected category is highlighted with a check mark
///    - Categories display with their respective icons and colors
/// 
/// 3. Enhanced User Experience:
///    - Seamless navigation between Category screen and filtered Home view
///    - Quick category switching without leaving the Home screen
///    - Visual indicators for the currently selected category
/// 
/// Technical Implementation:
/// 
/// A. Modified CategoryPage (presentation/pages/category/category_page.dart):
///    - Changed onTap handler to use Navigator.pop(context, category)
///    - Returns the selected category to the calling screen
/// 
/// B. Modified CategoryScreen (screens/category_screen.dart):
///    - Added optional onCategoryTap callback parameter
///    - Uses callback when provided, otherwise navigates to AddTaskScreen
///    - Maintains backward compatibility
/// 
/// C. Enhanced HomePage (presentation/pages/home/home_page.dart):
///    - Added PopupMenuButton in AppBar actions (Home tab only)
///    - Created _CategoryScreenWrapper to handle category selection
///    - Integrated with existing HomeBloc for state management
///    - Uses ChangeCurrentListEvent to update filtered category
///    - Uses ChangeTabEvent to switch back to Home tab when needed
/// 
/// D. Category Menu Features:
///    - Displays all selectable categories plus "Danh sÃ¡ch táº¥t cáº£"
///    - Shows category icons and colors
///    - Highlights currently selected category
///    - Error handling for category loading issues
/// 
/// User Flow:
/// 
/// 1. From Home Screen:
///    - Tap filter icon in AppBar â†’ Category dropdown appears
///    - Select category â†’ Home view filters to show only that category's tasks
///    - AppBar title updates to show selected category name
/// 
/// 2. From Category Screen:
///    - Tap any category item â†’ Navigates back to Home screen
///    - Automatically switches to Home tab if not already there
///    - Filters tasks for the selected category
///    - AppBar title updates accordingly
/// 
/// 3. State Management:
///    - HomeBloc manages current category selection
///    - TaskBloc handles task filtering based on selected category
///    - State is preserved across navigation actions
